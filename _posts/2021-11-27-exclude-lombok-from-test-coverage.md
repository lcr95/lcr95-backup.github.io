Lombok is a nice Java library that reduces the boilerplate in our code. We can simply add in some annotations and Lombok will generate the code during compile-time. It was used heavily in my project. Recently I noticed these annotations are pulling down the code coverage percentage in the unit test coverage report  generated by Jacoco and SonarQube and I don't want to spend time writing unit test for these class as it should be unit test properly in Lombok side.

<br/>



**Root Cause**

Lombok will generate code during compile time and these code is calculated in our unit test coverage report. All these class can simply contribute 10-20% unit test coverage, depending on your usage. 

<br/>



**Solution**

We can will configure Lombok to annotate the generated method with `@lombok.Generated`.  Once the generated method is annotated with correct annotation Jacoco/SonarQube will filter out these class from the unit test coverage report.



To configure Lombok, add the following class into your project (same level with `pom.xml`).

*lombok.config*

```text
config.stopBubbling = true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true
```

- `config.stopBubbling` - indicate that current location is root directory.  By setting this to `true`, Lombok will stop searching for more config.
- `lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation` - annotate generated class with  `@lombok.Generated`.
