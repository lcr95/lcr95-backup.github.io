ZSH is another Unix shell that have interacive feel. This article will guide you through on how to installing [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme.

Example:
{% include image.html src="post-zsh-example.png" data="group" title="Powerlevel10k Example" %}

# ZSH installation
Make sure WSL is installed before installing ZSH. In my case, I'm using Ubuntu 18 for WSL.

1. Install zsh : ``sudo apt install zsh``
    ```
    sudo apt install zsh
    ```
    <br>

2. Verify it with command `` zsh --version``. You will observe the ZSH vesion you have installed.
In my case is, ``zsh 5.4.2 (x86_64-ubuntu-linux-gnu)``.

3. Edit bashrc : ``vim ~/.bashrc`` and add following at the bottom :

    ```sh
    if test -t 1; then
      exec zsh
    fi
    ```
<br>

4. Refresh bashrc : ``source ~/.bashrc`` and your WSL will pop up something like below:
 {% include image.html src="post-zsh-init.png" data="group" title="ZSH Initialization" %}
  
5. Hit "2" and it will configured with the recommeneded configuration.
