You might be asking why am I creating this blog?

Documenting, is something that most of the software developers and engineers hate the most. Neither do I. I get fascinated by the idea by Gray, _"document , don't create"_.  Everybody just wanted to share about the best thing they have achieved and they will try hard to create something fancy. They normally forget the fact that sometimes the process/journey is more meaningful and valuable than the success itself. 

This reminds me that, as a software engineer, I always need to catch up with tons of technologies/frameworks/libraries to create software. Isn't that it is a waste if we did not record down the journey/learning? This could serve as my future reference and at the helping others who is facing the similar issue or problem.

Thus, I decided to start document down the journey and the things I learned starting the year 2020.
