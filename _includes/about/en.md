You might be asking why am I creating this blog?

I get fascinated by the idea by Gray, _"document , don't create"_.  Everybody just wanted to share about the best thing they have achieved and they will try hard to create something fancy. 
They normally forget the fact that sometimes the process/journey is more meaningful and valuable than the success itself. 

Documenting, is something that most of the software developers and engineers hate the most. Neither do I.
As a software engineer, I always need to catch up with tons of technologies/ frameworks/ libraries to create software. 
Isn't that it is a waste if we did not record down the journey/learning? 

Thus, I decided to start document down the journey and the things I learned.
