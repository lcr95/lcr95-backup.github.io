I'm a software guy who believes in technology and data.

You might be asking why am I creating this blog? Isn't it documenting is something that software developers hate the most.

I get fascinated by the idea by Gray, _"document, don't create"_.  It is a marketing strategy that 
talks about publishing tons of contents in regular basis and documenting the process is the best way to nail it. 

This made me think about giving back to the community doesn't really need to create something new and fancy.
My job as a software engineer required me to catch up with lots of technologies/ software frameworks/ software libraries.
It is a waste if I did not record down the journey/learning, isn't it?

Thus, I decided to start document down the journey, and all the things I learned.
